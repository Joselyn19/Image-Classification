# ADDA_CORAL
ADDA+CORAL in pretrain

## Configuration

Check params.py, where common params are defined. The `use_coral` controls whether or not to use CORAL in pretraining.

## Experiments

Test on 16-class-imagenet-test+White Noise, without any further training. Where setting ResNet50 means ImageNet pretrained, 16-class-imagenet fine tuned;
ResNet50-ImageNet means ImageNet pretrained only; CORAL means ImageNet pretrained, 16-class-imagenet fine tuned with coral loss on 16-class-imagenet-val+white noise; ADDA + CORAL means ImageNet pretrained, 16-class-imagenet fine tuned. All classifier are trained on 16-class-imagenet without other pretraining.
with coral loss and further trained with ADDA on 16-class-imagenet-val+white noise:
